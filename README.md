# rew2streammagic

rew2streammagic is a Python tool to parse Room EQ Wizard (REW) equalizer description files and apply the extracted equalizer settings to Cambridge Audio StreamMagic devices.

## Features

- Parse REW filter files and extract the first seven equalizer bands
- Supports various filter types (PEAKING, LOWSHELF, HIGHSHELF, LOWPASS, HIGHPASS)
- Maps REW filter types to StreamMagic-compatible types
- Communicates with StreamMagic devices to set user EQ parameters

## Usage

1. Prepare a REW filter file (see `example_data/` for samples).

1. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

1. Run the tool:

    ```sh
    poetry run python -m rew2streammagic.main <path_to_eq_file>
    ```

1. The tool will parse the file and send the EQ settings to your StreamMagic device, if it is supported by the API version.

## Example

See the `example_data/` folder for sample input files.
